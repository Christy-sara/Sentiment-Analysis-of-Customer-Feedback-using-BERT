# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback using BERT
A natural language processing (NLP) project that classifies customer feedback into sentiment categories
using the BERT transformer model for improved accuracy.

## What I Did
- Performed text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Built and fine-tuned a BERT classification model
- Evaluated model performance with metrics like accuracy and F1

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Key Insights
- BERT achieved significantly higher accuracy than traditional methods
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing) improved model stability

This project highlights hands-on experience in NLP, transformer models,
and practical model evaluation.
