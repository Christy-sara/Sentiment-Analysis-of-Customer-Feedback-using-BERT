# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback

This project uses **machine learning and natural language processing (NLP)** to analyze customer feedback and determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). A **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model is implemented to accurately classify the sentiments from textual feedback.

**Dataset:** Customer feedback data collected from reviews, surveys, or social media, containing textual comments and sentiment labels.

**Key Features:**
- Text preprocessing: cleaning and tokenization
- Implementation of **BERT** for sentiment classification
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Insights into customer opinions and satisfaction trends
